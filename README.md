# My Flet Projects

## Introduction

This repository serves as a collection of Flet projects I'm working on for personal exploration and learning purposes. It's a great resource for me to revisit past projects, track my progress in Flet development, and potentially share some interesting experiments (if you choose to make the repo public in the future).

# Project Structure

(Adapt this section based on how you organize your projects)

- Each Flet project will reside in its own subdirectory within this repository.
- Subdirectory names should be descriptive and reflect the project's purpose (e.g., ```to-do-list```, ```weather-app```).
- Within each subdirectory, you can have the following structure (optional):
- ```main.py```: The core Flet application file.
- ```assets/```: (If applicable) Directory for storing any images, fonts, or other static assets used by your project.
